### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-server.git
cd library-server
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
```bash
# Create virtual environment

## üîß Configuration

### Changing the Port

Edit `server.py` and modify the last line:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)  # Change 5000 to your desired port
```

### Finding Your Mac's IP Address

To allow the mobile app to connect from a real device (not emulator):

```bash
# On Mac/Linux
ipconfig getifaddr en0

# On Windows
ipconfig
```

Then update the Flutter app's `lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String _defaultServerUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:5000';
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test with curl

**Test borrow transaction:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "borrow",
    "student_name": "Test Student",
    "student_grade": "5A",
    "book_id": "BOOK-001",
    "borrow_date": "2025-10-20T10:00:00.000Z",
    "due_date": "2025-11-03T10:00:00.000Z"
  }'
```

**Test return transaction:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "return",
    "book_id": "BOOK-001",
    "return_date": "2025-10-20T10:00:00.000Z"
  }'
```

**Test add book:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/book \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "add_book",
    "book_id": "BOOK-123",
    "title": "Test Book",
    "author": "Test Author",
    "isbn": "123-456",
    "category": "Fiction",
    "added_date": "2025-10-20T10:00:00.000Z"
  }'
```

### Expected Console Output

When a borrow transaction is received:
```
============================================================
üìö TRANSACTION RECEIVED
============================================================
Action: BORROW
Student: Ahmad Rizki (5A)
Book ID: BOOK-001
Borrow Date: 2025-10-20T10:30:00.000Z
Due Date: 2025-11-03T10:30:00.000Z

Raw JSON:
{
  "action": "borrow",
  "student_name": "Ahmad Rizki",
  "student_grade": "5A",

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** Mobile app can't connect to server

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure the server is running (check terminal for Flask output)
2. Check firewall settings - allow incoming connections on port 5000
3. For Android emulator, use `http://10.0.2.2:5000`
4. For real device, ensure both device and computer are on the same WiFi network
5. Use your computer's actual IP address, not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

### Port Already in Use

**Problem:** `Address already in use`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

Or change the port in `server.py`.

### Module Not Found

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

## ü§ù Integration with Mobile App

This server is designed to work with the [Digital Library Mobile App](https://github.com/jonathanmui4/digital_library).

To enable communication:

1. **Start this server** on your computer
2. **Update the mobile app** configuration in `lib/services/api_service.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String _defaultServerUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:5000'; // For emulator
   // OR
   static const String _defaultServerUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:5000'; // For real device
   ```
3. **Uncomment** the API calls in the mobile app's `transaction_provider.dart`
4. **Run the mobile app** and perform transactions

The server will receive and log all transactions in real-time!

## üéØ Design Philosophy

This server is being built for a **tech-illiterate librarian** at a school in Jakarta. Every design decision prioritizes:

1. **Zero Configuration** - It should "just work" without technical knowledge
2. **Visual Feedback** - The librarian needs to *see* that it's working
3. **Automatic Operation** - No command line, no manual starting/stopping
4. **Reliability** - Works despite WiFi issues, power outages, or app crashes

### Why Version 1.1 Features Matter

**‚ùì Problem:** "The librarian has to find the computer's IP address and type it into the phone app"  
**‚úÖ Solution (mDNS):** Phone automatically finds the server. Librarian never thinks about IP addresses.

**‚ùì Problem:** "The librarian doesn't know if the server is running or if data is being received"  
**‚úÖ Solution (GUI Dashboard):** Big green checkmark = working. Red X = problem. Shows recent book scans.

**‚ùì Problem:** "The librarian has to open a terminal and type `python server.py` every morning"  
**‚úÖ Solution (Auto-Start):** Computer turns on ‚Üí Server runs automatically. Icon in system tray shows it's working.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Version 1.0 (Current)
- ‚úÖ Basic API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Console logging
- ‚úÖ CORS support
- ‚úÖ Android emulator compatibility

### Version 1.1 (Next - Critical for Librarian Use)
**Goal: Make it "just work" for a non-technical librarian**

- [ ] **mDNS/Zero-Configuration Networking**
  - Server broadcasts itself as `library-server.local`
  - Mobile app automatically discovers server on WiFi
  - No need to manually enter IP addresses
  - Uses `zeroconf` (Python) + `nsd_android` (Flutter)
  
- [ ] **Simple GUI Dashboard**
  - Web-based interface at `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`
  - Shows connection status (Connected ‚úì / Waiting for connection...)
  - Displays recent transactions in real-time
  - Large, clear text suitable for non-technical users
  - Visual indicators (green = good, red = problem)
  
- [ ] **Auto-Start Executable**
  - Package server as standalone `.exe` (Windows) using PyInstaller
  - Create `.app` bundle for macOS
  - Add to system startup automatically
  - Librarian just turns on computer - server runs automatically
  - System tray icon showing server status
  - Right-click menu: "Open Dashboard", "View Logs", "Stop Server"

### Version 1.2 (Data Persistence)
- [ ] SQLite database integration
- [ ] Persistent transaction storage
- [ ] GET endpoints for data retrieval
- [ ] View transaction history in dashboard
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities

### Version 2.0 (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Export data to Excel/CSV for reports
- [ ] Print transaction receipts
- [ ] Overdue book notifications
- [ ] Student borrowing history
